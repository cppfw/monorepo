= monorepo for cppfw libraries

**cppfw** libraries repositories are added as submodules under the `repos/` directory.
The submodules are configuret to `latest` remote branch. So updating the submodules with:
```
git submodule update --remote --init
```
Will always sync to latest release versions of the libraries.
